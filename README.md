# HeartBeatPeaks

This is a project to identify peaks in a heart beat signal. Namely the P-wave, T-wave and QRS Complex.

Features were engineered based on width, amplitude and area of peak. Perhaps the slope of the peaks will be used next time.
Plots of features against other features are shown in PNG files as labelled.

These pairs of features were used in a simply implemented KNN algorithm to classify what type of peak each were. They are in the PNG files named with KNN.
